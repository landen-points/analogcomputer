# analogcomputer
This project involves designing and building a simple analog computer capable of solving calculus-based
operations such as integration, differentiation, and summation using op-amp-based circuits to a proof-of-
concept level accuracy. The core components will include TL082 dual op-amps, a variety of passive
components (resistors, capacitors), and voltage regulators.

Instead of using a traditional PCB, the final prototype will be made using paper circuits. Paper circuits are
more DIY friendly, and will be open source. I am also interested in incorporating non-traditional
fabrication techniques as a proof of concept for analog computing. This approach aims to provide a low-
cost, flexible, and rapidly prototyped alternative to standard PCBs, as there is no lead time for PCB
ordering.

I gained inspiration from reading the Art of Electronics Second Edition (Horowitz and Hill) chapter on
op-amp designs for calculus functions (chapter 4), and further research into devices such as the Comdyna
GP-6.
